# cs1520project1
Project 1 part 1
Organized file tree
One page or multi page layout. Minimum of three sections/pages
You may use a frontend framework, such as Bootstrap or Foundation. You may also use a template, all I ask is that you do not use it as it comes. Add your own layer of style on top of what is included.
All pages (views and includes, etc) should be written in PHP, at least for this first part of the project
One component/page of your site should be a contact form, I would prefer this to submit to a database, but if you want to defer the database and have it email you or write to a text file, that is ok too.
Intelligent use of topics covered in class so far. Such as:
Use of variables, includes, arrays, functions, file reading etc.
When should I use [requirement]?
